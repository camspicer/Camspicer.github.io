                        I took three "gap" years before coming to school and had a lot of time to learn new things! One of my favorite things I learned in that time was to play the guitar. I am self-taught and really enjoy thoery, performance, and just straight jamming with my buddies! I hope to continue to improve while I'm in college.

                         My favorite guitar-based band would have to be Penny and Sparrow. This <a href="http://www.thedigitalcontinent.space/beginners-guide-to-our-favorite-band/">blogpost</a> describes my feelings about them well...

                            I started ice skating at 3 years old and started playing hockey the year after. I haven't put down the skates since! Hockey is a huge part of my life and I'm blessed to be a member of the Men's Hockey Team here at the University of Maine.

                            I am a redshirt freshman and play defense. The hockey program here at Maine is huge reason why I decided to come here.

                            Over the last 5 years I lived away from from and competed in juniors hockey. I played juniors for 7 different teams in 4 different leagues, in 5 different states, and two different countries. During that time I lived with 8 different host familys and made amazing friends!

                            Last year I was exposed to woodworking by my friend in Massachusetts. When I got home for the summer I felt inspired to get our my dad's tools and get to work!
